## Launching the benchmarks

```bash
$ cd <project-path>
$ time -p ./scripts/all_bench.sh 2>logs/err.log >> logs/bench.log
```

No console output, just wait the end of it. Logs can be seen during or after the end of the bench.

See _'scripts/*'_ to adapt the bench as defined into *'bench.js'* and *'all_bench.sh'*.

Refer to files in _'logs/*'_ to get our results.
